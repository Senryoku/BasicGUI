# Basic GUI

GUI system I used in my OpenGL examples [here](https://github.com/Senryoku/SEngine) before replacing it by [dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).
This is totally useless, but I wanted it to have its own repository as I like some parts of the design (even if the whole system is fairly limited).

Its a basic retained GUI system, "widgets" are derived from a basic class named GUIElement.
Text is displayed using font SDF (signed distance function) generated with SDFont (https://github.com/VDrift/sdfont).
